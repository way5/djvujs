/**
 * Throughout the code mostly vars are used, not consts or lets.
 * It's because of that in 2015-2016, when the library was created,
 * Chrome couldn't optimize ES6 code properly, which resulted in a big performance decrease,
 * about 3 times or even more. Now, in 2020, it seems than ES6 variable declarations
 * don't have that devastating impact anymore, so they can be used.
